This can be used for more than zooming, but that's what it was originally made for. \r\n\r\nThis is inspired by https://github.com/anvaka/wheel which makes it super easy to detect wheel scrolling, I wanted something similar for pinching / spreading. \r\n\r\nThis library uses [QuoJS](https://github.com/soyjavi/QuoJS) for the cross platform touch handling. If you already have QuoJS on your site you can remove the lines including it at the top of pinch-to-zoom.js.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n```\r\naddPinchListener(domElement, function (event) {\r\n    // All event properties are described below\r\n    zoom(event.x, event.y, event.delta);\r\n});\r\n\r\nfunction zoom(x, y, delta) {\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee the example for how to use this with Pixi.js\r\n\r\n## Event properties\r\n\r\n- **x / y** - The x and y coordinates the user appears to be pinching towards. This is in pixels from the top left of the screen.\r\n- **delta** - The total movement the user has performed with the pinch in pixels.\r\n\r\n## License \r\n\r\nMIT\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
